# Nate's Raspberry PI Ansible Playbooks

A set of simple ansible playbooks that make adding new Pis, managing their 
configuration (dotfiles), and updating their packages easier.

#### TODOS

- [ ] Write down a guide on how to add a new PI and describe the workflow.
- [ ] Add a link to an article describing my current Pi setup.
- [ ] Move current docker containers to a managed docker-compose.yml with an ansible role.
